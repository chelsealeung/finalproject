<h1>What does veterinarian really do?</h1>

<p>A veterinarian is a medical professional who protects the health and well-being of both animals and people. They diagnose and control animal diseases and treat sick and injured animals. They also advise owners on proper care of their pets and livestock. Most vets concentrate on at least one field such as small animals, horses, or livestock. Many also focus on special interests within these fields, such as surgery, medicine and dentistry.</p>

	<p>In order to become a veterinarian, they are required to earn a doctor of veterinary medicine degree. It typically takes four years. Although it is sometimes possible to gain acceptance to a college of veterinary medicine without first earning a bachelor's degree, most students have completed their undergraduate degrees before enrolling.</p>
